      <description>#GospelToday (Mk 9:30-50) They left from there and began a journey through Galilee, but he did not wish anyone to know about it.&#xA;He was teaching his disciples and telling them, &amp;ldquo;The Son of Man is to be handed over to men and they will kill him, and three days after his death he will rise.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to question him.</description>

      <description>#GospelToday (Jn 18:1 &amp;ndash; 19:42) When he had said this, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley to where there was a garden, into which he and his disciples entered.&#xA;Judas his betrayer also knew the place, because Jesus had often met there with his disciples. So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.</description>
